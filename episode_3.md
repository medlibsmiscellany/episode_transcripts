# MM.03: Our path to #medlibs
## Carrie and Tracy talk about how they became medical librarians. 
Carrie Price: That's cool Tracy. So I think we both came into it, through the back door. [laughs]

Tracy Shields: In a roundabout way. We came at it in a roundabout way, didn't we? 

Price: Yes we did. Didn't we? 

[Theme music]

Shields: Hi everyone and welcome to this episode of Medlibs Miscellany. I'm Tracy Shields. 

Price: I'm Carrie Price. 

Shields: And today we're going to be talking about how we became medical librarians. I think it's really interesting because I don't know of anybody that has gone directly from undergrad to graduate school to being a medical librarian, do you? 

Price: I can't recall anybody I know in the field

Shields: And I think that's pretty typical for - that kind of indirect path, is pretty typical for the librarian world in general. It seems like most people -

Price: Mhmm.

Shields: - don't kind of go straight into being a librarian, and if you are one of those people that did do that, I'd love to hear your story, like what made you decide early on to be a librarian, because I think - 

Price: Mhmm

Shields: - most of us probably come to it from another direction and have done other things first and eventually kind of find themselves in library land. 

Price: It wasn't until my early 30s that I started working as a medical librarian. How about you? 

Shields: Yeah, I - when did I go to - Yeah I kind of have to let me do the math - 

Price: [laughs]

Shields: - in my head. Um, yeah, I went - I graduated from grad school, library school, 10 years after I had gotten my undergrad degree. So yeah, it was about early 30s when I started, 

Price: Me too. 

Shields: being a medical librarian. And even becoming a medical librarian I - what didn't go directly to a library, but we'll get more into that later. 

[Swoop sound]

Shields: So how did - how did you end up becoming and discovering medical librarianship and deciding to be a librarian. 

Price: Yeah, I - I like this question because I think like we said, everybody comes into it uniquely and I feel like I definitely came into it uniquely. I graduated from college around 2000. I was a music Ed Major, and, I didn't really want to do that, but I really didn't know what I wanted to do, so I was just sticking it out. When I was like a junior in college, I hurt my back and I ended up going to physical therapy, and the wonderful physical therapist there hired me on to be a physical therapy technician. 

Shields: Oh cool. 

Price: So yeah, so they are the people who - and bless their hearts. They let me help with more than just folding towels. 

Shields: [laughs]

Price: I really helped people with exercises and I - I just remember doing so much. So for about three years I was a physical therapy technician in an orthopedic clinic attached to a hospital and I really liked the vibe. And if I had been less dense at the time or thought things through, I think I probably would have become a physical therapist. But I remember thinking at the time that it was already too late. So it's just so silly because it wasn't too late at all. 

Shields: I don't think it's ever too late, and as somebody who has had multiple injuries that has required physical therapy afterwards, I have such deep respect for physical therapists because that's a strenuous job. 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: That's so - there's a lot going on there. 

Price: It was really fun helping people with their exercises and then I would uh, you know, get them set up to have the e-stim which everybody loves. Of course I didn't touch the e-stim machines, but I remember almost every patient and thinking what a cool job that was. So then, when I graduated I stopped working at the clinic and I had to get a real job. I had to work a full time job. And I ended up in development, which is fundraising, and I'm sorry to say that I'm really not very good at that because you have to be a total extrovert and you have to raise money. And it's a thankless task I think. 

Shields: Yeah, I don't think I don't think I could do that at all. 

Price: I look back at this story and I think there are things I learned along the way. So even working in fundraising for what, like six or seven years. I'm still really grateful for that because I learned so much and, uh, my first job was at a private school, so I was working at a private school doing the annual fund, which is like their annual expenses, and I had one of the best bosses I'll ever have. She was an amazing boss and you never realize you have an amazing boss until you don't have them anymore. I think.

Shields: Right. 

Price: So I - I think about her a lot. And then I moved on, to working for an animal shelter, raising money for kitties and puppies, and that was fun. But I just didn't feel like I was doing what I could really do in this world. So at that point around 2008, I decided to go to library school. 

Shields: So had you worked in a library before, or did you just kind of look around and you're like, "I could be a librarian!"

Price: Yeah, I can't remember what motivated me to do that because in high school I think I worked for like a couple months as a library page at my local library.

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: And I remember our next door neighbor was one of the public librarians in my town, and I thought she was so cool because she was like this single older lady. And she just seemed really super cool. And I've always liked to read, but that's not the reason people go to library school. You don't say "I love books; I'm going to go to library school."

Shields: What, you don't read all day? [laughs]

Price: [laughs] Yeah, so I think I was just like okay I need a masters degree that's going to help me get a job that I can do. And I - I don't think I had a lot of confidence in myself for actually getting in. I went to University of Maryland, before it was called the iSchool and before any of it was online. And I remember getting the acceptance email and justice getting a little tear in my eye because I was like what, like, I really didn't think I was going to get in. And then after I got accepted into library school, I said to myself, well, I got it, get a job in a library and I applied at Hopkins and started working in Circ (circulation) and Reserve. So the next four, five, six years maybe? I don't know, four years! I worked in Circ and Reserves. I felt like that gave me a really solid base for understanding what goes on in the library. 

Shields: Did you have a lot of interaction with patrons, or were you kind of behind the scenes in tech services? 

Price: So much - both really, half and half. But I had so much exposure to the front desk and I felt like - I just waved everybody's fines, basically because I didn't think they should have fines. 

Shields: [laughs] 

Price: And the coolest thing I ever found in a library book was â‚¬1100.

Shields: Really?!

Price: But I tracked down the person and gave them back their euros. But I was like my somebody's using euros for a bookmark. 

Shields: Wow. 

Price: It was fun. And so I finished library school - Actually, I should say there was one more event that led me into Health Sciences. So it wasn't completely arbitrary. And that was that in 2008 my mom got diagnosed with appendix cancer. Which is this really rare, ambiguous, kind of hard to treat cancer considered a rare disease, and it turns out that one of the specialists for this cancer and the surgery was in Baltimore, MD at Mercy Medical Center. And she had what's called HIPEC - heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cytoreduction. But the surgeons just called it MOAS - mother of all surgeries. 

Shields: Oh wow. 

Price: She was in the hospital for two weeks, and my dad and I kind of traded off staying with her during those two weeks. And I was like, this is weird but I really like the environment of the hospital. I like the hustle and bustle, the elevators going up and down, the people in the cafeteria, the doctors, the staff, the nurses. It was just like I was really drawn to this environment. And this was in my first year of library school so it made me say, hmm, I'm really interested in the way people you know take care of their health or seek health information. And the Internet was still sort of evolving. It's ever evolving I guess, so I started taking consumer health information classes in my program as electives because I thought it was all very interesting. 

Shields: Oh, that's really cool. So like just being exposed to the medical environment - and you had already been exposed, as with the PT stuff, but seeing it in the hospital environment in a little bit different and having that personal angle, -

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - kind of made you discover that that was an option. 

Price: For sure. 

Shields: You said you took, like, consumer health classes. Did you take, like, other other courses that were specific to medical librarianship? 

Price: No, I don't remember that there were any at the time I - I know that some schools do have a Health Sciences major or focus, but mine didn't. 

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: At least I don't recall, so I just took a couple consumer health - MedlinePlus, and Stats on the Web, and the way that people look for things. 

Shields: So did you - once you kind of discover that, did you want to go straight into a medical library after grad school? Was that the plan? 

Price: So I don't think I was super aware of all the opportunities that await librarians when they get out of school because I was thinking I would be, oh, I'll be a government librarian. I'll be a law librarian, or I'll just be a public librarian. I don't mean "just." I'll be a public librarian. 

Shields: Right.

Price: Which, they have some of the considerably more difficult jobs dealing with all of that. Anyway, that's a different story. And, I didn't think about it anymore. I just thought it would be nice to work in Health Sciences and didn't even make the connection. And then, I graduated in December 2010 and I just started applying for jobs, applying for jobs, applying for jobs. And, not doing a very good job of it either. And actually I know some people who went to library school and never got a job in libraries despite years of trying, so - 

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: I do feel really fortunate. Well, I was at an all staff meeting for my university and I physically bumped into this woman in the restroom and I said - she was like "oh excuse me." She had a very - she - [laughs] she was quirky. [laugh] And I said, oh, you're the librarian at Bayview and she said, "no dear, I'm the head of the Welch Medical Library and we have an opening and you should apply." Like, I just remember some sort of weird conversation like that bumped into her. Got her confused for somebody else. Told her I was just at a library school and she was like, well, we're going to have some openings. So I did apply. It took, you know, in academia it takes a very long time, to, get anywhere. So I - I waited months and months. But I did put in an application and I let them know that I had a physical therapy background and met some of the people over time. And then in 2012, sheesh, I got the job at Welch. So it was really my first librarianship job, and, I loved it from day one. And I can tell you I had some of the best mentors in the field, I think. So I'm grateful for them. And I can also tell you that the first search I ever had was on traumatic brain injury in pig. That was the first thing I ever -

Shields: Oh wow. 

Price: - that was the first thing I ever had. [laughs] And that is what I've been doing since 2012. Although I have changed jobs since then. And vocational awe aside, I like this job because I feel like every day I get a - I get a puzzle and I get to put the puzzle together and then put it back and then start again the next day. 

Shields: Mhmm.

Price: So it's very stimulating. [laughs]

Shields: That's a great way to describe it, because I never really thought of it that way. But it is you - you kind of pull the puzzle out, you put it together, and then you take it apart and shake it up, and, and, see - 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - what comes out next time. 

Price: Yeah, it's a different puzzle every day. I think it's really interesting. And then in some ways I've made full circles. So here - 

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: - here are my two stories and - and how I've made full circles, and then I want to hear about you. So before I was born, I was a high risk baby and the amniocentesis test had just come out, and my mom had to go to Johns Hopkins to get this test to make sure that I was ready to be born. So then the fact that as an adult I kind of came back full circle to these halls of medicine, I always thought was pretty cool because - 

Shields: Oh that's really cool. 

Price: - it was because of that test that I was born okay. You know? And I don't know much about the amniocentesis exam, 

[talking over each other] 

Shields: I - I 

Price: except I - I think it tells you when your baby's ready. 

Shields: [laughs] I'm really tempted to Google it because I'm like crap what does it tell like

Price: [laughs]

Shields: I think it - 

Price: We'll - we'll have to look it up. We'll look it up. We'll put it in the show notes. And then with the job I'm at now, it's where I went to school. You know everybody has some sort of defining college experience, so to kind of come back to that, I feel like I've made a lot of full circles in life, so I'm excited to see what the future holds, but I also, - I kind of look back on my story with awe, like, whoa how did I do it? I don't know. But here I am. 

Shields: Well thank you for sharing. 

Price: I'm here. 

Shields: That's - that's a really, - that's a really neat story. And like just kind of literally bumping into somebody. 

Price: [laughs] Yeah. 

Shields: And next thing you know you're a librarian, -

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - in a library. 

Price: Yeah, I'm - I'm, um, pretty thankful that she gave me a chance, but I'm glad that they gave me a chance. It was special. 

[swoop sound] 

Price: Tracy, how about you? We'd like to hear how you became a medical librarian on this circuitous path of life. 

Shields: Yeah so for me, there were - there were multiple stops along the way. And, kind of similar to your story, there was one kind of -

Price: Mhmm

Shields: - brief conversation that changed the course. So I, as an undergrad, studied biology. I had planned to go to medical school. Ever since I was very little, I wanted to be a doctor. And there's family lore that I used to tell people, when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would say I'm going to work at the CDC. 

Price: [laughs]

Shields: I don't know how I knew about the CDC [laughs] or what I thought the CDC did, but I - 

Price: Oh wow. 

Shields: - thought hey I'm going to work at the CDC. 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: As an undergrad, I studied biology, was pre-med, did all the things, 

Price: Mhmm

Shields: and had encountered, you know, just what I now in - in hindsight know, know is burnout with a nice episode of major depression on top. So that um, I decided to take a year off before doing anything. After grads - uh, after undergrad. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: So in taking that time off, I thought well. I'll get a job, I'll figure out what I want to do and I started working for, um, my dermatologist. I was in her office one day and she was like "oh your graduation's coming up. What's your next plan?" I was like "I don't really know, I just - I think I need to take a year off and kind of figure it out." And she goes "I thought you were pre-med" and I'm like "yeah but I don't know if I really want to do that or not." She goes "well, come work at - be my medical assistant. And you know I'm going into -

Price: Ah. 

Shields: - a private practice. You can come be my medical assistant and decide if, you - you know, you want to be a doctor." And I'm like, "okay, that sounds cool." So I started working with - she opened up a private practice, with as a dermatologist with a plastic surgeon, and I became their - their medical assistant. So I saw, you know, in the clinic seeing patients every day got that aspect of healthcare. And I realized, that as much as I like doing it, I didn't want to be the doctor like I inter - like, I liked interacting with the patients, but I didn't want the responsibility of being the doctor. I was trying to figure out like, -

Price: Oh I see. 

Shields: - alright if I'm not the doctor then what do I do like cause for my whole life? I was like I'm going to be a doctor and now I'm like, I don't know if I want to be a doctor.

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: So I kind of thought around, like, well, do I want to be a nurse? Do I still want to provide patient care? 

Price: Mhmm

Shields: And then I was like I think I just like all the things surrounding medicine, and not necessarily the act of providing care in that way. I was kind of at a loss. I didn't know what to do, and I had an opportunity, kind of on a whim, I saw a job posting a temporary contract job to be editorial assistant for a medical textbook and I was like well, maybe, maybe I'll try that. So I started - I did that. And you talked about having like the best boss you've ever had. My boss there was amazing.

Price: Aww. 

Shields: And it was for Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. The - the 10th edition.

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: And so it's, it's - I think it's now in the 13th edition, so this was a while ago. And so I was trying to figure out, you know what I wanted to do and again, I just had my undergrad degree. I didn't have anything else. And I was working on this medical textbook and the editors was - was a recently retired pharmacology professor and he was just really nice and he was, you know, often telling me stories about working in the lab and doing all these cool things. And so I thought well, you know, I really like the editorial stuff, but you know, this is - I was living in Nashville at the time. I was like there's not a whole lot happening and you know all the editorial stuff seems to happen out of New York. And I don't know if I really want to move to New York. 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: I - I really do like this and he's like, well, you know, and I was telling him that this one day he's like "well, if you're not sure what you want to do just yet, he said a colleague of mine is going to retire in a couple of years, but he still, you know, has his lab going and he needs one of his last grad students just graduated and he needs some help. Why don't you do that?" And I was like - he goes "you can figure out if you want to do research." And I was like okay that sounds good. So, I got a job in this pharmacology lab and it was fantastic because there was no pressure to publish. There were no grad students. He, like I said, he had just graduated his last student and he was nearing - he was coasting to retirement and he, he just really enjoyed - Dr. Wells just really enjoyed mentoring and he was finishing up his last paper sort of thing. And so I was working there. I was doing a lot of bench work and pipetting things and you know, and I enjoyed it because you know I had done that as an undergrad and it was getting a lot out of it. And one day he's like "I, you know I need you to run over to the library and get a couple of these papers for me." I was like okay. So he sends me over to the Science and Engineering Library. And I realized what he wants wasn't there, so I had to go to the biomedical library to get it. And this was, gosh, this was late 90s. And so I was photocopying things and I came back, and gave him the articles and I said "oh by the way, while I was photocopying this one, I saw this similar one and I just went ahead and got it for you." And he was like, "oh. okay." So he - he was, you know, writing his papers and he would have me read his papers because I'd worked in editorial stuff. So he's like, "hey, can you double check that I've got this citation right and it's the right formatting for this journal, so is my grammar okay?" So that - that experience, I was helping him write this paper and he kept sending me over to the library to get other papers for him and he offhanded one day said, "are you okay with me sending you to the library all the time?" And I'm like, "yeah, I like doing it," and he's like "oh good because it's like having my own personal librarian." And, at the time I was like, oh. Yeah, you know I do like [laughs] being over in the library and, and finding these things. And you know, at that point he was having me do literature searches for him. I didn't realize what I was doing at the time. You know he did kind of just talk me through stuff he's like, "here's this thing called PubMed and you can look things up" and had been messing around doing lit searches for him. I was spending all my time in the library. And when he said that I was like, oh, you know, that might be a good idea. So I kind of had this, - I kind of got myself to a crossroads where he was nearing, he was like finishing up and retiring, and I had about nine months left before his retirement, and I was looking at grad school and everybody was like just apply. Apply here at Vanderbilt, pharmacology you're - you're - you're in, you're solid. You've got two of the former department heads writing, writing your recommendations and stuff. I mean, you're golden. And here I'm sitting doing some things and I'm like but I really like looking at those articles and getting that stuff and so, In typical fashion, like in again, in hindsight, I should have figured this out. I started researching what it took to be a librarian, and I realized good - in two years have a masters degree and if I wanted I could always go on to get a masters or PhD in pharmacology after that. But if I did the reverse, it would be a lot longer. So I decided I was just gonna go to grad school and be a librarian. 

Price: Ding Ding Ding. [laughs]

Shields: So I applied, I got in state at University of Tennessee and decided I would move away from Nashville for a couple of years and go to classes on campus. And they also had remote, -

Price: Mhmm.

Shields: - but I didn't want to do remote because I'm originally from outside that area. So I thought I'll move home for a couple of years, and, go to grad school, and, see what happens. And after that, even - even when I was in grad school, I knew that I wanted to do like, science or medical related library stuff. But they didn't really have any specialization for that. I just picked my classes and talked to my supervisor and things like that about what I should, what I should take, and what I should do. And they knew people that did internships with Oak Ridge National Labs, which was nearby. And so there was a lot of potential opportunities even if there wasn't class - formal class work. But I could do my project, my special projects, and take seminars and stuff and things like that that would kind of, give me a little bit of that background and experience, so. I finished up that and, I had - at that point I had never worked in a library. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: I had only just gone to the library as the patron, right, -

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - and used library stuff. And I still didn't even know if I wanted to be in a library. And I had to start applying, - finishing up the program, I started applying to all these jobs everywhere because I was willing to move. And like you said, you know all these academic programs just take forever to go through the hiring process. And so I started like a year ahead of time and was applying to positions as a science librarian. As a medical librarian, you know doing with nursing, you know anything that was kind of related to medicine or science in any way. I was applying to those jobs. And nothing was really happening. And, I saw a job posting for a medical editor for a medical publication. 

Price: Oh wow!

Shields: And I thought, well, maybe I should just apply to that and see what happens. And I did and they were, like, instantly like, "oh, we definitely want a librarian! Because all of our medical editors have been librarians and they do their own research and they write their own stuff." And I was like okay, and they're like can you move to New York? And I was like I - I guess and they're like, can you move in the next month? 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: And I was. Like I guess? [laughs] So it was the fastest thing ever. Like within, within two months, I had this job and was moving to New York to be a medical editor. Again so, yeah

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: So it was like here. I plan to go into medicine and be a medical librarian or some kind of science, health sciences librarian, and I'm not even trying to be a librarian yet, right out of school. And so I - I took that job in New York and, it was really, great experience, I enjoyed it, -

Price: Oh wow. 

Shields: - so much. And -

Price: Like the city? 

Shields: I lived just north of the city in the suburbs. 

Price: Oh wow. 

Shields: I lived in Westchester County, but it was, -

Price: Okay, yeah, yeah. 

Shields: - you know, a quick train ride into the city if I wanted to go. 

Price: Oh wow. 

Shields: You know it was - it was kind of funny because here I thought, before grad school I was like well I don't really want to move to New York and be editor, editorial things, and next thing I know, I go to grad school and I still find myself in New York doing editorial things, [laughs] so.

Price: Oh my. I don't think I knew that about you. 

Shields: It worked out really well, but I was feeling kind of, I guess, homesick? 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: And, and I started thinking well. I probably should do something in a library just to make sure I don't want to be a librarian, and - 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - at that time Eskind Biomedical Library at Vanderbilt had an internship that they did for new librarians. And I thought that was going to be my only real chance to kind of be in a library since I didn't have library experience. And their program was such at the time that they took people that didn't have library experience or even a library degree, like if you had a PhD and just wanted to learn library things, you could do that. So I moved back to Nashville and started doing that, and never kind of left library land. And it really just, it all clicked, like everything clicked. From my experience working with patients, to - 

Price: Right. 

Shields: - working with researchers, and doing bench research, to the writing part of it - all of those things, kind of braided together to really work as a librarian. A medical librarian for me. And so, -

Price: That's so awesome. 

Shields: Once you know, once I kind of discovered searching as a - as a career, it just, 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - made sense, like all the pieces fit together. 

Price: Yeah, that's so cool. What a story. 

Shields: Yeah, so I kind of, jumped across multiple things, but they all kind of led to the same place and -

Price: A lot of epiphanies along the way. 

Shields: Yeah, and you know the, the kind of side comments of "hey, you should be, -" "You're like having my own personal librarian," and "you sure do like to spend a lot of time at the library," and [laughs] and you know, this is like, -

Price: Mhmm

Shields: - how did I not really think of this before? 

Price: Yeah, yeah.

Shields: But you know, working in publishing, I know - I knew a lot about copyright, I know a lot about the journal publication process. I mean, yeah, you can learn those things, but seeing it from the other side has been really interesting and provided a lot of context for what I do and the work that we - that we do. 

Price: And that's a unique perspective that I think a lot of us don't have. 

Shields: And, so eventually I did end up getting library experience, but up until two years after - like I graduated from library school in 2005, and it wasn't until 2007 when I joined Vanderbilt's Eskind Library that I even did anything in, physically in a library as a job. 

Price: True, that's - that's really interesting. And so in Eskind, did you have a lot of FaceTime with library users and researchers? 

Shields: To some extent it wasn't, - we would have desk hours and so I got a little bit of that. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: What I ended up doing more than that was a lot of the online email support and things like that. 

Price: Okay. 

Shields: And I would do a lot of on-call, where if our library techs couldn't handle a question at the reference desk, that the librarian on-call would - would take care of it, 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: And that's where I also got into clinical rounding. 

Price: Oh!

Shields: And got into some of - because of having the experience of working directly in patient care. It kind of made sense for me to do clinical rounding because I've been in a clinical environment before you know?

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: And so I worked in a couple departments, but really kind of stuck mostly with the cardiovascular intensive care unit. 

Price: Mhmm, mhmm. That's some tough work. That's tough, rounding. 

Shields: Yeah, yeah, you see, you see a lot of things there. 

Price: Right. 

Shields: And I was kind of back up for some pediatric rounding. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: And then I left there to come to my current position and in my current position I kind of have - it's a small library and so I do a lot of, a lot of different things, including like clinical rounding. I round now with Pediatrics. And do a little bit of everything, -

Price: Wow. 

Shields: - and provide literature search support, and training, and you name it. Kind of do it. 

Price: A little bit of everything. 

Shields: Yeah. 

Price: I think - I think that's the nice part of this job is a little bit of everything, so if you get tired with one thing - 

Shields: Mhmm

Price: - you can focus on another thing. And if you get burned out you can try something else, [laughs] I guess. 

Shields: Right, like if I'm - if I'm working on a search and it's just not clicking or I need to take a break because it's a topic - 

Price: Mhmm

Shields: - that is just not very fun to work with, now I can start working on collection development things and start adding books to our database for purchasing, 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - or go spend some time at the circulation desk, or whatever it might be. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: There's always something to do and you know, even if I want to go - my, my boss and I kind of joked that we need to go sling books and get out our frustration, and that's just, you know, shifting the collection or doing some weeding or whatever it is just to take a break, right? 

Price: Mhmm. Yeah, I can relate to that. When I worked at the animal shelter my office was in a building adjacent to the kitties and the puppies. So when I needed to take a break - 

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: - I would go visit the kitties, mostly kitties. I'm a cat person, I'm sorry dog people. I'm sorry Boone!

Shields: [laughs]

Price: But yeah, so I would go visit them, and like people think it's really sad, but it was a really nice animal shelter to work at so I didn't feel very sad at the time and I did get two very special kitties out of the deal. But then when I changed jobs and I'm like okay, I need a break like I can't go look at the kitties anymore. What am I going to do? Oh, so I ended up spending a lot of time in the P's. You know what I mean by the P's?  

Shields: Mm-hmm

Price: Yeah, I - I just spent a lot of time, and at that floor - at that library it was the basement floor had all the P's, which is, I think fiction. Oh my God I'm going to out myself here.
 
Shields: [laughs]

Price: So I spend a lot of time there and I did read a lot of books at that time because it was pre-smartphone and, I just remember that was my break. I went from cats to books. 

[both laugh] 

Price: So, trophy. 

Shields: Well, we are librarians. I mean, the stereotypes come from somewhere, right? [laughs]

Price: Yeah they do. And then actually, once I started working, one of my friends Katie, who we will meet probably in a later, she's like you gotta learn to knit. 

Shields: [laughs] 

Price: I was like knit, I'm not - I don't knit, but, guess who knits now? [laughs]

Shields: Yeah, so that's how I learned how to knit, 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: - is one of my one of my coworkers at the library had learned how to knit and she was like, "hey, do you want to learn how to knit?" and I'm like "sure." So - 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: - there is a group of us that, um, met and she taught us how to knit. 

Price: Wow. 

Shields: So yeah, I learned to knit from one of the library tech. She's now a librarian. 

Price: Oh, nice. Yeah, I don't, it's not a pre-rec, but it's -

Shields: No, and I don't have a cat. But I did at one point. I just don't have one right now. 

Price: I hope Boone's not mad at me. 

Shields: I just have Boone. 

Price: I - I do like dogs. I like Border Collies. 

Shields: Yeah [laughs] 

Price: And, and some dogs, some special dogs. That's cool Tracy. So I think we both came into it through the back door. [laughs]

Shields: In a roundabout way. We came at it in a roundabout way. 

Price: We did, didn't we? And actually some of your story made me think too that when my mother was in the hospital and I would go down to get coffee in the mornings right next to the coffee was the medical library. It was just this little room. It was all, you know, volumes of bound journals. And I never saw anybody in there, but it was a glass door and a glass front and I would go peek in and be like, oh, that's kind of cool. Like is that a thing? There's a medical library here? 

Shields: [laughs]

Price: And I think that might have helped me to think about it too. But yeah, isn't it cool? 

Shields: Yeah. So do you think your - the background and the kind of circuitous way you came to medical librarianship has made you a good medlibs? 

Price: [laughs] Huh. Well, one of the things I think I bring to this profession, which is like such a silly thing to say, but, I really like words and I really like spelling -

Shields: Mhmm

Price: - and language. And I think that's been important for the searching that I do to understand the etiology of work. 

Shields: Oh yeah, definitely. 

Price: Yeah, so that's been useful. And then just having a lot of interest, like I haven't stopped learning. I didn't necessarily have the background when I came into it, but I've continued to pursue things in research design and public health and statistics. As people who follow me on Twitter know I passed EPI Stats just a couple days ago. 

Shields: Woo!

Price: [laughs] Yeah, that wasn't - that wasn't very fun, but I did it. But it does feel like lifelong learning, and I definitely don't get bored. And I can say that other jobs in other fields, I got bored 

Shields: Mhmm.

Price: I don't get bored now. How about you? 

Shields: Yeah. Very similar in that. This has allowed me to have a lot of varied interests and - what I find so fascinating is how, like all the little things that I've picked up along the way, and kind of the, this, the side routes have all still become useful, right? 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: It's, interacting with patients and being comfortable in the clinical environment. It's, doing the research and being around researchers and kind of knowing what they're like and being able to speak their language, - 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - or understand when they're - what they're talking about things. And having a lot of personal interests and curiosity and that lifelong learning that has really informed how I can do my job. One of my favorite reference questions was somebody asking about an article that they read one time, and, it was - they didn't know what - where they read it, but it was something about somebody scratching their scalp. Down to their - their skull and I was like, "oh, that's The New Yorker article!" - 

Price: Oh really. 

Shields: " - the - the itch one!" And they're like "how did you know that?" I was like "I read it. It's wild!" you know? So just, you know, the things that you encounter outside of work that can inform work and make you a better librarian. 

Price: Yeah, for sure. 

Shields: Which now I guess I'm gonna have to dig that up and find the article and share it in show notes.

Price: Yeah, I don't know that one. 

Shields: Yeah, it's - it's some like, uh persistent itch and so they kept scratching the top of their head, like - and caused a wound that would not heal -

Price: Mhmm

Shields: - and eventually got down to the - their skull. 

Price: Yikes. 

Shields: Yeah. Things you don't want. 

Price: I remember reading these big stories in the Washington Post when I was a kid because I grew up around that area and one was about Morgellons disease.

Shields: Mhmm! 

Price: I think it's Morgellons -  where you think you have worms coming out of your skin. 

Shields: Yeah, so I knew about that because back when I worked for the dermatologist, she actually had me like, go look it up and try to research it. Like even back then I was, you know, being the minion of all these people I was going and doing the research for them.

Price: Wow

Shields: But - 

Price: Yeesh!

Shields: Dermatology. Man, that's - that's an interesting field. 

Price: Yeah, there's not much that grosses me out, but I think dermatology might gross - 

Shields: I, I think the only thing that really grosses me out is ocular trauma. Eye things are - are kind of where I have to start drawing the line. I have very high tolerance - 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - for a lot of things, and I'm - I can't believe I'm about to admit this story. But one of my - when I moved to - to Vanderbilt's library and took that job, another librarian started the same day as me and, um, her background was music. 

Price: Mmm

Shields: And she had - she had planned to be like an opera singer and she ended up like somehow going, you know, like the rest of us not directly going into what she planned. 

Price: Wow. 

Shields: But ended up in library land. And, the second or third day of work, she asked me, she goes, "do you - did you get into this because you like weird and gross things?" and I was like, "well, I don't think so. But I mean that probably doesn't hurt" - 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: - [laughs] "that - that I'm okay with weird and gross things."

Price: Yeah, yeah. 

Shields: I'm like, "why do you ask?" She's like, "have you ever heard of botflies?" And I was like - 

Price: Butt flies??

Shields: "Yes, actually I have." 

Price: Oh "bot." 

Shields: She's like - yeah, botflies. They're flies that will bite you and infect you with these, their larva. And - 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - it, like, incubates in your skin and, you - it like, crawls out of your skin and, you know there's like botfly larva that erupts out of your skin. It's absolutely gross. 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: But,

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: I knew about it because of working for the dermatologist. Because you see weird things like that. 

Price: When I was getting to know my medical library coworkers, we were all like, "well, you really can't gross us out." You know, like there's not much you can do to gross, us out. Although I have to admit I have - I had to look it up to make sure I was saying it right. Trypophobia. 

Shields: [gasp] Is that where - 

Price: Fear of little holes. 

Shields: Yes! 

Price: Which is why I probably don't like the dermatology stuff. But whenever you show me pictures of like a Lotus flower, or like little holes, I'm just like, "oh gross." 

Shields: Close up of pores. 

Price: Oh! No I can't handle it. I can't take like, Doctor Pimple Popper or anything like that. Yuck.

Shields: Oh. I - again, I guess because of working for a dermatologist and seeing that up close and personal, I kind of, uh developed a tolerance for it, and so I'm kind of, 

Price: Hmm. 

Shields: - like fascinated by pimple popping videos and things like that. 

Price: [shudders] 

Shields: Botfly, botfly videos are similar to that

Price: I'm not gonna look that up. 

Shields: But grosser. I know. Don't. 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: Maybe I'll put it in show notes, but I'll put it with warnings so people don't necessarily, 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - click on it without, 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: - without knowing what they're getting into. 

Price: If you're a medical librarian and listening to our podcast, what grosses you out? We'd like to know. 

Shields: Yeah. 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: Because there's a lot of potential things. 

[swoop sound] 

Shields: Now that you've been a medical librarian, with all the ways that you got there, would you, in hindsight, still want to be a medical librarian or do you kind of wish you would have jumped on to another path? 

Price: It's hard to imagine another path at this point. For me. And I don't even know how I got here in the first place, but it seems to fit me well. For the time being, I'm quite happy with the profession and intend to stay in it, and I'm always kind of mind boggled at how I ended up here but, like I said earlier, grateful too, because there's been a lot of people who played a role in mentoring me or hiring me or giving me a chance, so. I think about that a lot. How about you? 

Shields: Mhmm. Similar. I can't imagine doing something else because, how much I enjoy what I do. 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: But, I could see where I could have taken a different path. 

Price: Yeah, for sure you had a couple of different options. 

Shields: Yeah. But I really - I mean it scratches all my itches. 

Price: [laughs] Yeah it does. 

Shields: It - you know all the things that I enjoyed about the various things I did in the past, all kind of mesh - Oh gosh, that's a horrible pun. That's not what I meant. 

Price: MeSH! MeSH it together. 

Shields: All kind of come together in, in what I do as a reference medical librarian, so. It's - it's a good fit for me. 

Price: Well, I have one last question for you. 

Shields: Mhmm? 

Price: Can you imagine being a medical librarian prior to digitization, of databases and records? 

Shields: My former boss retired, she retired a few years a few years ago, like right at the beginning of the pandemic, she retired. She has told me stories of what it was like, back in the day. And that's kind of how I know the most about like Index Medicus, and, - 

Price: I was going to say. 

Shields:  - and things like that. And like her stories of what it was like to actually go to the National Library of Medicine and do a class on Medline and searching for that. And how they had like, folders of key articles in various fields so they wouldn't have to look them up constantly, but knew that - 

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: - those were the things that people asked the most. Like having all that stuff -

Price: Right. 

Shields: - it just kind of kind of mind blowing to me because, so much of what we do now is instant. 

Price: It is. 

Shields: And like having to take the timeâ€¦ And I, I mean, I did it when I was minion for all these other people, of like, literally going to the library into the stacks and pulling the bound journals and seeing, seeing, the actual article and - 

Price: Mhmm 

Shields: - making copies of it. And, I mean we still do that, but it's kind of usually ILL and kind of - 

Price: Right. 

Shields: - behind the scenes, and most people don't get hands on like that. And I, -

Price: Mhmm. 

Shields: I can't imagine what it would be like to have to literally flip through, books to find things and not have PubMed online, and, - 

Price: It would be tough. 

Shields: - command li- - I mean, I remember doing the dialogue command line searching as part of my classes in grad school. 

Price: Yeah me too, a little bit. 

Shields: But like if you had to do that as 100% of your job. I just, yeah. 

Price: And it costs money. 

Shields: I'm - I'm grateful. Yeah. 

Price: Right? So you, you had to get it right. 

Shields: Depending on the database, it could be by the minute. Or by the search or however it -  

Price: Right. 

Shields: - was broken down. 

Price: Somebody told me on Twitter how they used to build the searches, you know, by hand first and then go use them to search, instead of like, - 

Shields: Mhmm. 

Price: - iteratively searching things. They would build it all first and then go search because it costs them money. I just can't. [exasperated sound] 

Shields: Right. 

Price: That would have been hard. 

Shields: I remember doing that in that one class and it was so hard because you had to do so much of the work and you didn't even know if you - 

Price: Right.

Shields: - if it would work. 

Price: Right. If you had a mistake.

Shields: You know, you'd have to just - 

Price: Mhmm. Well, we've come a long way baby.

Shields: Definitely. I do appreciate that I can be iterative in my searches and, 

Price: Yeah. There is a bit of instant gratification built into searching PubMed these days, I think. 

Shields: Definitely! Definitely. 

[swoosh sound] 

Price: Well, Tracy, what's our next episode going to be about? 

Shields: I have thoughts. I have all kinds of thoughts.

Price: Okay. 

Shields: You could talk to new medical librarians. 

Price: I'd love that. 

Shields: I mean, we've been, both been in this for a while now, but to talk to some new people. 

Price: Yeah. 

Shields: New, fresh to the field and see what their experience has been. Or we could talk about, I think something we both kind of touched on here, but didn't outright name, and that is imposter syndrome. 

Price: I was going to ask that question. Do I have impostor syndrome if I'm just an impostor? 

Shields: How do you know if you're an impostor? 

Price: [laughs] 

Shields: Is that something you decide, or is something that's decided for you? 

Price: I guess I'm going to have to read some evidence. 

Shields: Yeah. We could also probably do an episode on vocational awe because there is a lot of good conversations to be had about that. 

[swoosh sound] 

Shields: And I mean and I think that's how we both kind of ended up doing this and, entering this field is we have varied interests and there's a lot of things that we find interesting and want to talk about or discuss so, yeah. 

Price: Keeps me up at night. Well, should we tell people how to contact us? 

Shields: Sure you can, if you want to contact us, you can email us at medlibsmiscellany@gmail.com. We are also on Twitter at @Medlibs_Misc. Or I am @tcshields on Twitter. 

Price: I'm @carrieprice78. 

Shields: We'll probably be, hopefully in the near future, if I can ever get my things together, and have a website other than the substack. But we're also on substack too medlibsmiscellany.substack.com . I like it. I like it. 

Price: Tracy, it's been fun chatting with you and I learned so much about you that I didn't know yet. 

Shields: Yeah, same. 

Price: Same. 

Shields: I'm going to have to start picking your brains about physical therapy stuff. 

Price: I tell everybody to do their core exercises. If your back hurts core exercises. Knee hurts? Core exercises! 

[swoosh sound] 

Price: And one more thing before we go. We'd like to thank Jenn Monnin for being this episode's transcriptionist, as well as episodes one and two. Thanks Jenn. That really means a lot. 

[applause] 

Price: Yeah well, we'll see you next time we hope you'll come back for the next episode of Medlibs Miscellany. Bye! 

Shields: Bye!
