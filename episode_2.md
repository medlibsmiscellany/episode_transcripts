MM.02: 2023 MeSH
No crabs were harmed in the making of this episode.
Tracy Shields: Look at that. We really are - we're going to nail this, one of these days, we're going to nail it. 
[Theme Music]
Carrie Price: Hey Tracy!
Shields: Hi Carrie! 
Price: Welcome back everybody to Medlibs Miscellany. This is episode number two. And if you're back with us, we're so glad that you decided to come back and join us again. I'm Carrie Price. 
Shields: I'm Tracy Shields. 
Price: And today we're going to be talking about Medical Subject Headings. And that's because Tracy is a Medical Subject Heading expert. You know that we call them "MeSH" [pronounced "mesh"] for short - Medical Subject Headings. We're going to talk about that today. 
Shields: Yeah, because I can't quite quit going off on Medical Subject Headings and making Twitter threads about them. 
Price: I love your Twitter threads. 
Shields: I like making them. 
Price: I've learned so much. I don't read the MeSH updates as much, and then I get to look at your threads and understand what's happening, so. Thanks for doing those. 
Shields: Yeah you're welcome. I unfortunately spend a lot of time looking at the updates and saving files and looking back at previous years and just really diving into the controlled vocabulary that is MeSH. And just for the record, I am not a cataloguer or anything like that. I don't know why I just kind of fixated on MeSH, but this goes back probably a decade or more. Yeah pretty much every search I do has MeSH somehow, and only the last few years taken my obsession to Twitter to share my thoughts on MeSH. 
Price: Can you tell us a little bit about MeSH? Like personally one of the questions I always get when I'm teaching non-librarians is "why do I need to use these? Can't I just use keywords?"
Shields: I mean you can, but if you're doing a search in PubMed, even if you don't use MeSH you're using MeSH because one of the things that happens is something called Automatic Term Mapping and that is where when you put a keyword into the PubMed search box it does something called Automatic Term Mapping where it maps to a Medical Subject Heading to try to help your search out. And sometimes that works really well and sometimes it doesn't. But what Medical Subject Headings are are indexing terms that get applied to represent the full text and concepts of a paper without having to text mine all the full text. And keep in mind we've now been able to do text mining on large scales until fairly recently. 
[swoop sound] 
Shields: You can think of them as tags that allow you to have a little more control over things because there's a lot of different ways you can, you can talk about a particular topic like - you can - like for "heart attack." The Medical Subject Heading is actually "myocardial infarction," which is the medical term for it. 
Price: Mhmm
Shields: But there are other ways you can describe that. And what using the MeSH term allows you to do is compensate for those variations and to even get more specific than that depending on what you're trying to search for. And so - 
Price: Yeah
Shields: It's, it's really a handy tool because it will allow for variations and, like, a lot of the surgical literature there's some - epon - actually there's quite a bit of eponyms that happen with procedure names and even instruments and things like that, so. You can do those, but you can also have MeSH terms that are specific for a procedure that will compensate for not using an eponym or other terms. 
Price: And how far back do they go? 
Shields: So MeSH as we kind of know it started with, um, the National LIbrary of Medicine who controls that. And it goes back to the 1960s. But even before that it kind of came out of the Surgeon General of the Army's indexing that they did, something called Index Medicus. Every year they put out a compendium of the published literature and they would have indexing for that. So you could look up a particular index term like in the back of a - literally in the back of a book, right. You'd look at the index and it would assign those terms. So it's a lot like how that came about but it's more structured in that there's a hierarchy, there are more specific terms, there's different sections of the tree that may have multiple places with the same term. So there's a lot of specificity and variability with it and it allows you to have those terms and they change over time too right so - 
Price: Mhmm
Shields: - a lot of things have happened since the 1960s, and - 
Price: Yeah
Shields: there are terms that come into favor and go out of favor. Like, for example, Previously it was called "impotence" but it's, now the term is called "erectile dysfunction," and I think that happened sometime in the 90s. It may or may not have been associated with the, um, the approval of Viagra. 
Price: Oh yeah. [laughs]
[theme music]
Price: I mean there's a lot going on this year. 
Shields: There is. There's… And there's a lot of background that we can potentially go over to talk about some of the new changes to MeSH. I mean just take COVID-19. That's -
Price: Right. 
Shields: That's a whole new thing that's happened in the last few years and there's now MeSH terms for that. So, 
Price: And it started out as a supplementary concept, right?
Shields: Right! And 
Price: Yeah
Shields: So that's kind of a whole other thing too. So Supplementary Concepts are terms that can get added at any point to help with, um, indexing. But what Medical Subject Headings are are something that happens only once a year, that are updated only once a year. And, so, subject headings that have previously been the supplementary concepts exist and sometimes supplementary concepts stay around for years before they become MeSH. 
Price: Also I think it's really interesting to note that the Medical Subject Headings used to be applied by humans. 
Shields: Right
Price: Up until, really recently, right? 
Shields: There's a great video, and we'll put it in our show notes or something, about um showing how indexing was done back in the day. 
Price: [laughs] Oh I haven't seen it!
Shields: It's really cool. It's a black and white film from like, the… late 60s I'm guessing? 
Price: [laughs]
Shields: - showing these indexers looking at the full text of an article and applying MeSH terms to it and they're literally typing on a little index card to, to, to make it. 
Price: Wow. 
Shields: It's a really cool video. But um - 
Price: But now, now what happens? 
Shields: Now it's mostly - I think 100% I think now, done by artificial intelligence, which sometimes works really well and sometimes does not work very well. 
Price: Right
Shields: I there - that happened, I think they were moving towards that with machine learning anyways, but, uh, all of the AI indexing started in March of 2022, so now - 
Price: Oh wow, so like just this year. 
Shields: Yeah, so, everything now is fully AI indexing, with I think they must do some type of quality control, but they obviously can't look at everything - 
Price: Mhmm
Shields: - with the sheer volume of literature that, you can't - you can't have a human look at everything anymore.
Price: Yeah. I remember - that's right because the medical literature is growing exponentially. 
Shields: Mhmm
Price: It's like - it's tough to keep up with. 
Shields: and that was even before COVID. Like, 
Price: Right. 
Shields: with COVID the literature is just, exploded. 
Price: Yeah, it has. Uh, I like MeSH because it gives me an idea of how things are described in the literature. There's always entry terms and Tracy was talking about Automatic Term Mapping, those entry terms are - well, they have to do with how things get mapped. That's right? 
Shields: Right. 
Price: I think. Yeah, and then it shows you where it exists in the hierarchy, so what terms and concepts are narrower and what terms and concepts are broader. 
Shields: It's important to know that there's not always a MeSH term for something. Something could be relatively new, in which case - like at the beginning of the pandemic when COVID was first being described there wasn't a MeSH term for it. And what they did initially because it was such a time sensitive, important topic. They added those supplementary concepts, terms to kind of be placeholders for the - what we assume would eventually be Medical Subject Headings. And we could talk a bit more about that in a minute but um… those - those kind of are placeholders and then eventually if there's enough literature about it and there isn't a good Medical Subject Heading, they will add new MeSH terms. And it's funny because sometimes you think there's something that should be a MeSH term and you look at it - the record - and it will tell you when it was first made a MeSH term and it can be pretty surprising. And one of my favorite examples of that is the MeSH term for "chocolate." 
Price: [laughs] Oh really?
Shields: Yeah, it only became a MeSH term in 2017. 
Price: Oh my gosh. 
Shields: I know. Like, chocolate has been around forever. I mean - 
Price: A substance. 
Shields: And it's so delicious!
Price: When you search for it - yeah right? We need our chocolate!
Shields: Yeah! 
Price: If you search for it does it only go back - does it only go back to 2017? 
Shields: Well it does go back further because previously it was under "cacao" 
Price: Okay. 
Shields: But you know if you were trying to find, for example, like, literature that provides evidence for the health benefits of dark chocolate, and you wanted to use that as a MeSH term you're only going to find things going back to 2017 or so, if you only use the MeSH term. That's why it's important to use keywords because there was stuff talking about the importance of chocolate - or if there wasn't, there should have been. I mean come on. It's chocolate - right? 
Price: [laughs] of course!
Shields: um, prior to 2017. And the only way to find that is to use another term, like "cacao," which may not have been as useful. Or to use it - 
Price: Right. 
Shields: - as a textword somewhere else. 
Price: Yeah. Huh. So when you see that little date underneath the definition 
Shields: Mhmm
Price: that tells you when it was introduced? 
Shields: right. Another example of that is "menstrual hygiene products." Which -
Price: Huh
Shields: - only became a concept in 2007, and
Price: What?!
Shields: Yeah! Right? I mean, I'm pretty sure menstruation has been happening for all of human civilization
Price: I think so. Yeah. 
Shields: Yeah, pretty sure. 
Price: [laughs]
Shields: There have been products that have been used throughout history
Price: But it was never indexed in MeSH. 
Shields: Yeah. There wasn't a term specifically for that. Anything prior to 2007 was indexed with, usually, um "tampons, surgical," or surgical tampons. 
Price: Oh yeah. 
Shields: Which are not necessarily the same thing, or -
Price: Yeah.
Shields: - at least not used for the same purposes. 
Price: No way
Shields: Even though they can, um. You might do it for - you might use surgical tampons for, um, oh gosh, now I want to look it up and see what you would use it for. Like, just, wound care. 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: Right? 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: It doesn't just necessarily have to be associated with, um, menstrual
Price: menstrual - menstruation. Yeah. Hmmm
[Explosion sound]
Price: Should I ask you about the update now? 
Shields: You can. 
Price: What else should we go through? 
Shields: Well you can talk more. I feel like I'm doing all the talking.
Price: But it's - you love MeSH. When I teach MeSH, I always point out, especially to librarians, searchers, I always point out previous indexing, and I point out um "See Also." So when things get introduced like "chocolate," it doesn't get retrospectively - retroactively? - it doesn't get retrospectively indexed. 
Shields: Right. 
Price: But it would go back under "cacao." So if you did search and you find stuff previous to 2017 that's because previous to 2017 it wasn't "chocolate," it was "cacao." So it's kind of like adding more levels to the hierarchy, is that right? 
Shields: Right. And that's one of the things - you have to be so careful that you can't assume that a term that you're using has always been in use. It could have changed over time and shifts in the term itself - and we can talk a little bit more about this with some of the population groups - does change over time, but in other cases it could just be an all new term. In which case, like you said, it doesn't go back and add previous - it doesn't add that term to previous records, so you may have to use a different term. You may have to use a broader term. You may have to use only keywords to get at something. 
Price: Yeah. One of the ones I show is "plantar fasciitis," previous indexing was "fasciitis" and "foot diseases." So neither of those are really specific enough, they're pretty broad. So that one you use "plantar fasciitis" which was introduced, I don't know in the last 10 years, or 20 years, and then you end up using just keywords because "foot diseases" is way too broad and "fasciitis" can talk about other parts of the body, so it doesn't work. 
Shields: Right
Price: Um, and then there's like, "see also," so that will tell you what other concepts are related and that's important to note if you're a searcher because maybe, maybe they're related in a way that's important to the search so like again with "plantar fasciitis" when people come into a clinic with heel pain - heel pain, um they're often treated like it's a heel spur and "plantar fasciitis" I think, so the "see also" concept under "plantar fasciitis" is "heel spur" because they're related and treated in similar ways. At least that's my understanding. So I think it's always important when you're looking at the MeSH term to look at the previous indexing and the "see also."
Shields: So that's your favorite term?
Price: I guess you could say it's my favorite term. 
Shields: [chuckles]
Price: It's not horribly traumatic at least. 
Shields: [laughs]
Price: I mean some of these are like, pretty traumatic
Shields: Yeah
Price: So I don't want to say like, oh yeah "traumatic brain injury" that's my favorite - no that's not my favorite term. 
Shields: "PTSD." Hah, no. 
Price: Yeah right? Do you, do you have a favorite term? 
Shields: You know, I don't know that I have a favorite term, but I do kind of have a favorite thing that isn't a term, and that is crabs. 
Price: Oh really? Oh yeah!
Shields: Yeah, so, um, we kind of mentioned this in our intro episode, but it fits here because one of the things that I do is, along with looking at the annual updates to MeSH is to kinda keep an eye on when the PubMed User Guide gets updated. Just to see what's happening with that because a lot of users look to that. And so um, 
Price: Yeah
Shields: There's a lot of information in that. But one of the things I discovered a few months ago was they were giving examples of how you use the field tags in PubMed and that's limiting to like the title/abstract, or a MeSH term, or text word, or different places - different things like that. An example they gave was "crabs" for MeSH
Price: [laughs]
Shields: And I thought "oh! Huh. Well let me just do a search in PubMed for "crabs"[MeSH]. I didn't realize that was a MeSH term!" Well, it's not a MeSH term actually, and what it does - and the only way you can know this is to do the search in PubMed and then look at the Advanced Search settings and see the Search Details, and what - what that shows is that "crabs," since it's not a MeSH term will actually do somethings similar to Automatic Term Mapping in that it will map to two different MeSH terms that are known for crabs. One being the marine animal that is sometimes on our dinner plates -
Price: [laughs]
Shields: - and the other being stigmatized infectious disease that - 
Price: [laughs]
Shields: - that organism is sometimes sexually transmitted. So - 
Price: A genital crab. 
Shields: Yeah. So you can have - 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: - two different kinds of crabs. And that's - that's, you know, one of the reasons where you need to be careful about if you use MeSH terms which ones you pick, and even if you don't use MeSH terms to be aware of MeSH because that Automatic Term Mapping will use them for you, and you could end up getting things you don't expect because of how that happens.  
Price: Right. Yeah because if you put in an incorrect MeSH term it's going to map it for you which I don't think I realized this year until the whole "crabs" debacle. 
Shields: Yeah. And I don't think I even knew about that. And I don't know if it's something that's new that they're doing as part of all of the other things that happen with, quote, "New PubMed." I keep calling it "New PubMed" even though it happened in 2020. 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: But - 
Price: Right? 
Shields: It's still new. It's still new. 
Price: Right. 
Shields: There's a lot of things that changed with that and I don't know if this was part of it or if it always did this and I never discovered it, but. When I saw that I did what I do, which is go to Twitter and start talking about it and that's, uh, that's kind of how we came up with our, one of our mascots, which is MeSH the Crab. 
Price: Yeah, MeSH the Crab. He doesn't - he doesn't make any sounds though. 
Shields: No. At least not the - not the marine crab. 
Price: We couldn't figure out - no. [laughs]
Shields: I don't know about the other type. [laughs] I've never investigated that. 
Price: Tracy has two stuffies: ones a crab, and the other is the other kind of crab. Is that right? 
Shields: [laughs] Yeah.
[both laugh]
Shields: So this is not an endorsement - 
Price: [laughs]
Shields: - this is not an advertisement. But if you've ever looked at giant microbes
Price: Yeah!
Shields: They have one for the crab, louse. 
Price: Okay. 
Shields: Yeah!
Price: They're fun. That's a fun little - We'll uh, we'll uh have to link to that, in our, in our show notes. 
Shields: Yeah. 
Price: I remember we were chatting that day on Twitter when we both realized "crabs" was there and we were like "'crabs' isn't a MeSH term!' And I needed a good laugh that day and I'll tell you, I was weeping in my cube with laughter about how funny that was. I don't know, it just struck me as really funny that of all the MeSH terms that could have been chosen to demonstrate MeSH, they chose a term that wasn't MeSH, and I - and it - and it was a funny one too. 
Shields: Well, and I think it was around the same time that the whole TikTok phenomenon with the corn kid 
Price: Yeah!
Shields: So there was this song going around about corn, and, but, like 
Price: [laughing]
Shields: So the corn kid has this song and here's this thing about crabs, and it just kind of happened. 
Price: It was really funny. 
Shields: Yeah. 
Price: It was funny. And it's still there. 
Shields: Yeah!
Price: So if you want to look at the PubMed Help file and, search for "crabs"MH, it's still there. You can find it. I think it's great. Tracy I know you've really dug into the update this year, 2022. Um, what's stood out to you about the MeSH update for the coming year. 
Shields: So, um, something that kind of touches on something we've already talked about a little bit. There's a new MeSH term for "Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome," which is Long COVID. 
Price: Okay. 
Shields: And that is - that's - that's now a MeSH term. They added in 2020 the supplemental concept for it, but this year it officially became a MeSH term. And - 
Price: "Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome?"
Shields: Yeah, so that's essentially Long COVID, right? 
Price: Mhmm. That's, yeah. 
Shields: This is one thing that, you know, it doesn't retroactively go back and change, but if something was a supplementary concept and it got moved up to a MeSH term, that gets applied retrospectively. 
Price: Okay. 
Shields: But it's not added, it's just changed. So instead of it - the previous indexing that it had with the supplementary concept, it now no longer has that as a supplementary concept. It has it as a MeSH term. So it's, sort of retrospective, but not exactly
Price: I see. 
Shields: Cause it was already there. It's kind of just a - a name change, kind of thing. 
Price: So those supplementary concepts are reserved for emerging topics? 
Shields: Right. 
Price: And newer things, yeah. 
Shields: Yeah. 
Price: And eventually if they keep growing they turn into an official MeSH term. 
Shields: Right. And there was a - in one of the NLM webinars they did about MeSH, talking about it, one of the things mentioned is that if something has a supplementary concept and it has more than 200 or so results in PubMed they'll make that a MeSH term. I don't think that's exactly the cutoff because we can probably find examples where there is more than that. 
Price: Right! "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection"
Shields: Yeah that's a great example. 
Price: That's been around for decades. It has a lot of indexed literature, but it's still a supplementary concept. 
Shields: Right. 
Price: As you pointed out to me once. 
Shields: Yeah and, I'm really surprised it hasn't become a MeSH term yet. But, and then, you know, there are things that get updated like, um. I think there was a nomenclature change in like 2020 about "Lactobacillus," um, and they've now one of the new um MeSH terms for 2023 this is - is reflecting those changes from the international body that does the nomenclature for organisms for stuff like that. The scientific names. 
Price: Okay. 
Shields: So that's another MeSH, new MeSH thing. 
[swoop sound]
Shields: Probably the biggest change is to the populations groups tree. 
Price: Oh yeah. Tell -  
Shields: and there's -
Price: Tell us about that. 
Shields: Yeah, so there's there's a little bit of background that you need to know for some context, and that is this last year there was kind of a - a blow up that happened on Twitter showing how um, the term for what was previously I think "African American Ancestry Group" or something like that, um was now "Blacks." And so there was a lot of, uh, rightfully so, anger about some of the ways that there were terms that were being used inappropriately. There were population groups and um, racial or ethnic group terms that were either there or not there or using outdated terminology. And so, um, a group got together and wrote an open letter to NLM, and we'll put links in our show notes to all of these things. 
Price: Mhmm. 
Shields: And there was a lot of discussion on Twitter about it. And NLM responded to the letter and actually had a couple of listening sessions, and I believe they've actually planned some listening sessions in January - 
Price: Yeah
Shields: January 2023 to discuss -
Price: That's right. 
Shields: - the new MeSH terms too. Um, but there is a lot of work and there were people who helped NLM behind the scenes. And were working diligently to update and make some of those terms more inclusive and more international. Because um, one of the things that happened last year with - when I say last year, like 2021-2022 MeSH, is that somehow in how they changed up some of the population groups they ended up dropping um terms for Aboriginal Australians. And the - 
Price: Mhmm. I noticed that. 
Shields: Some people on Twitter, um, brought that to our attention. And it looks like they have made a real effort this time to fix some of those issues. It's not perfect, 
Price: Mhmm
Shields: But I think it's a big step in the right direction and there are a lot of new terms, there's a lot of new terms, things specifically said that are related to the OMB, which is the Office of um, the Office Management of Budget I think maybe? 
Price: Oh, okay. [laughs] I think you're right. 
Shields: But um, OMB has, um, a lot of specific ways they that refer to race, racial and ethnic groups at the federal government level, and I think NLM has made a lot of changes with that in mind to kind of -
Price: Mhmm
Shields: - align it with some of those demographics, and have added, um, better definitions, have added more groups, and have changed some of the definitions to better suit reality. 
Price: Mhmm
Shields: That said, there are still some problematic and stigmatizing terms that you'll see listed in those records as part of entry terms. 
Price: Yes I noticed that. 
Shields: And I think that's kind of an unfortunate thing that we have to have there because of how things were previously referred to in the past, and - 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: - and to compensate for some of that terminology. Um, it's not, it's not ideal, but I think they kind of have to be there. And so. 
Price: Right. 
Shields: Um, you just kind of have to be aware of it and be conscientious in how you use those. Because sometimes, and this is probably going to be a whole episode in itself. Sometimes you have to use terms that are not preferred and can be quite stigmatizing, and, um, racist, and problematic. 
Price: Mhmm. 
Shields: And offensive, with searches - 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: Because that unfortunately is how things were described in the literature previously. 
Price: Right. I think our medical librarian Twitter friend Alison Burnis has done a thread on this. 
Shields: Mhmm. 
Price: I might be wrong but I think it was her. 
Shields: Yeah. 
Price: And yeah, if we're - if I'm sitting with a group who's searching on, uh, racial groups and I have to introduce potentially offensive language, I always find that really uncomfortable. Uh, and it's a matter of, like, finding historical literature because that's the way it might have been used. So that's something that we sometimes have to explain to our library users is that if we're looking for literature going back to the '60s, the '40s, before, we have to use those terminology, which isn't ideal. 
Shields: And even - 
Price: I'm glad to see - oh. 
Shields: Oh I was going to say even just going back to just the, the '90s, and the '80s. There's a lot of - 
Price: Oh. True. Yeah, unfortunately not - 
Shields: - potentially offensive terms. 
Price: It's not that far distant. 
Shields: And I think, I'm not positive, but I think it was Whitney Townsend and some of her colleagues at the University of Michigan maybe, that shared on Twitter some language about how you can justify or describe why you're using some of these terms in a search to be -
Price: Mhmm. 
Shields: - more conscientious and um, understanding of the need for inclusivity. 
Price: Yeah -
Shields: So we'll share those links. 
Price: - they're out there. We - I think we - we really appreciate all the work that the medical librarian community has put into having these terms changed with NLM. We acknowledge there was a lot of labor that went into that. 
Shields: Yeah with the people that have worked behind the scenes. And you know, that's a lot of emotional labor for, um, previously and currently marginalized groups, that, 
Price: Right. 
Shields: Are doing their best to be the best representation that we can have for these terms. 
Price: I had a search this week on Indigenous Populations, including North America and Australia and I had written the search at one point and then by the time I went to translate it this week I realized there were all these new terms like you said. Aboriginal Australians is back. 
Shields: Mhmm. 
Price: American Indians and Alaskan Natives now splits up. Now there's two terms to represent those groups. 
Shields: And I think they've also added one specifically to Canada. For their Indigenous Tribes. 
Price: They did. Indigenous Canadians 
Shields: Mhmm 
Price: There are a couple of tribe names. I was wondering why there are only a couple of tribe names. And not more. 
Shields: There is one specifically, I think the Pima? 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: Was one of the terms, and that's an interesting thing that might be another topic to discuss later on, um, because there's some interesting history about that population and their genetic profiles being used for diabetes research I think. 
Price: Oh really? I had no idea. 
Shields: I didn't have any idea either. I just happened to one day catch, um, a mention that somebody was giving one of those NLM History of Medicine talks. 
Price: Uh-huh
Shields: And she was talking about it and it was really interesting. Well I'll dig that up and we can add it to show notes. 
Price: Okay. Well Tracy that's a lot happening for the 2023 MeSH. Are there other things that we should note as we're going into the new year? 
Shields: Um, I think one of the things we kind of have to keep in mind is these terms are always changing, and as we mentioned there's a lot of work that gets put into those changes, and if you find something that doesn't have a term or you think a term is needed, you should tell NLM. Because how else are they gonna know? If - you know, if you have a subject area that you're very familiar with and you think their MeSH for that is inadequate or could use some work, then give them feedback because sometimes they do listen. Hopefully they listen more now than they used to, 
Price: [laughs]
Shields: - because I think that has been some of the criticism, justifiably so, that people have told them for years that this needed to be looked at, and, 
Price: Yeah. 
Shields: It didn't get a lot of attention. And I think with some of the, with some of the um, changes that we've seen there is a push to make things right in some regards and we should - we should make the most of that opportunity. 
Price: Well I'm glad that's changing. And yeah I've been sitting in on some of the listening sessions and the MeSH webinars. There are these free MeSH webinars through the NNLM so if you are interested you can sign up. Anybody can sign up for free and you get to hear how PubMed works, how MeSH works, so you can hear more. I'm really excited about the changes Tracy. 
Shields: I guess, I do want to say, keep in mind like we said before, as great as these new MeSH terms are, they're only now going to be - if they're new and not like, changing an old term, they're only now going to be applied, so, you'll still have to compensate for that somehow with other terms, or keywords or whatever, so kinda keep that in mind as you do your major searches in PubMed. 
Price: I remember that happened, I think in 2018 or 2019? This MeSH term came out, "Critical Care Outcomes," and I worked with people who were specifically interested in critical care outcomes. Well it didn't have any literature assigned to it yet and now it's been a couple years and it still doesn't have that much literature assigned to it yet. So you'll see these terms evolve over time. 
Shields: Mhmm. 
Price: And that's only a good thing. So keep an eye on those terms you're watching. Those people you search for so you can understand what's happening and feel - Well this is all really great news and I'm excited. 
Shields: Yeah me too. Thanks for letting me go on and on about Medical Subject Headings. 
Price: We love to hear about Medical Subject Headings and MeSH the Crab especially. 
Shields: Yeah.
