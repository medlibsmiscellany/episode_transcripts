## Title: Carrie and Tracy start a podcast - no, really!

Tracy Shields: [laughter] I swear we're going to have to get better at that. But that's okay. [continued laughter] I was waiting visually for your hands to get closer together

Carrie Price: I was waiting for you

Shields: That's going to be a running theme of this podcast I suspect. 

Price: [laughter]

[Theme Music]

Shields: Alright. Are we ready? We're ready. 

Price: We're rollin!

Shields: Welcome everyone! It's our first episode of Medlibs Miscellany. I'm Tracy Shields.

Price: And I'm Carrie Price. 

Shields: And we are both medical librarians. And that is where we came up with medlibs. 

Price: Medlibs Miscellany. We didn't make that up, "medlibs" is the name of the MLA listserv, the Medical Library Association listserv. And then as far as we know it started being used on Twitter about 2008 or 2009. And so we wanted to give credit to the people who started the whole hashtag. This is December 2022, our first introductory episode, and we tweeted last week to ask who came up with medlibs. Turns out, a couple of people, maybe starting with Nikki Dettmar, also David Rothman, Jules Shore, Guus van den Brekel. So we wanted to acknowledge those people and thank them for creating the medlibs community on Twitter andâ€¦ 

[applause sound]

Price: And also explain that that's where our name comes from.

Shields: And just a quick disclaimer that should probably go on every episode with us, we will probably mispronounce things

["Oops" soundbite] 

Shields: Whether it's people's names, or a medical term even though we are medical librarians. We don't necessarily know how to best pronounce things, but we may be able to spell them really well. 

Price: Yeah we spell them really well but I'll still say ed-im-uh instead of ed-EEM-uh

[laughter]

Shields: AN-gin-uh, an-JIE-nah. Which one is it? 

Price: Yeah! We're medical librarians. 

Shields: Yeah.

Price: Yeah. And the Miscellany part is because Tracy and I have a lot of ideas and I guess that's something we should talk about Tracy, is how we met and why we want to share our ideas

Shields: Yeah, so we got chatting because of Twitter and we're both on there and pretty active with the medlibs hashtag and we started talking even outside of that, and me being nerdy and quirky we started talking about how you do the Five Minute Friday videos, and I asked you if you'd ever thought about doing a podcast. And you were like "I don't wanna do a podcast by myself" and I was like "well I would help you with a podcast" so, next thing we know, we're doing a podcast. 

Price: Yeah right? And um, I think it's a good platform to try out and we have so much to talk about, so we hope you'll tune back in for our next couple of episodes. Do you think we should introduce our animal co-hosts? 

Shields: Oh, that's right. You may occasionally hear an interruption of the animal variety. If it's a dog barking

[dog bark]

That would be Boone. 

Price: Can you tell us a little bit more about Boone? 

Shields: Boone is a 12 year old lab and hound mix, and he is kind of a red-ish blond color. He likes to interrupt me when I'm talking. 

Price: Yes, and so I have a cat Melvin.

[purr sound]

He's a tuxedo cat so he's always ready to party

[cat meow]

He's 18 years old and he knows when I'm on the phone, so you might hear him when I'm trying to record. And we already know what our next episode is going to be. Our next episode is going to be about Medical Subject Headings and everything that's happening with MeSH 2023. 

Shields: So yeah um, going back to being nerdy and quirky, one of the things that I do is stalk the PubMed User Guide page to see whenever it gets updated. And I think back in September there was an update to it that gave an example of using a term with tags to do a search and the example they gave was "crabs"[MeSH]. 

Price: [laughter]

Shields: And it doesn't do exactly what you'd think it would do, and so I shared that on Twitter and it just kind of took off. 

Price: [laughs]

Shields: And now the kind of unofficial mascot for MeSH or medical librarian is a crab. So we're going to have a mascot called MeSH the Crab. And also Snarky Shark because sometimes when we talk about searches, especially peer reviewing some systematic review searches we get a little snarky about it. 

Price: Yeah we do snark, but we snark nicely because it's really just critical appraisal, right? 

Shields: Right. 

Price: That's what I think. Snarking is critical appraisal 

Shields: And also learning experience. 

Price: Yeah. Well a couple months ago - I should mention this too, because talking about snarkiness. So originally I had wanted to do a YouTube Live Stream where I pulled up systematic reviews and critically appraised the methods, but then I didn't think that would fly. [laughter] so, [continued laughter] I mean who's going to watch that anyway? We're happy to critically appraise your methods for us if you volunteer your methods for us to critically appraise, but that's not how we're going to do this. Tracy you mentioned you're nerdy and quirky, and like where did you get that phrase from? It has to do with something. 

Shields: Yeah so our theme music by Musictown on Pixabay is actually titled "Nerdy and Quirky." 

Price: Yeah!

Shields: And that's how it jumped out at me, and actually we both thought it was a cute music so it fits. 

Price: It's stuck in our heads, so yeah. [begins singing theme music, then both laugh] 

[theme music plays]

Price: We hope you'll tune in if you're a new medical librarian, if you've been around for awhile, if you're a health professions librarian or some health adjacent type of librarian or searcher. Hey this is for you. So you can write to us with ideas or episodes, you can ask questions. Maybe we'll do a Q and A, and I think that's it for this first introductory Tracy, right? 

Shields: Yeah, so let's tell people how they can get in touch with us. If you want, you can email us at medlibsmiscellany@gmail.com, or we're both still on Twitter. It hasn't quite died yet. So I am @tcshields, S-H-I-E-L-D-S

Price: And I'm @carrieprice78. When I - this will tell you a little bit about me, because I signed up for Twitter long before I knew I was going to use it, and the idiot that I am put my birth year on it. So @carrieprice78. There's no secrets there, you know how old I am. [laughter] and I'm not changing it. 

Shields: Do the math.

Price: I'm not changing it now. That's me, you can find me there. Um, so that's - that's our first episode, and we hope to hear from you. We'll see you next time. That wasn't too bad. 

Shields: That was pretty good. 

Price: Alright thanks everybody!

Shields: Bye!

Price: Bye!
